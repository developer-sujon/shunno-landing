              <p>When it comes to having your own website or web application, it is now more of a necessity for all
                businesses. Choosing the right kind of technology is important to garner a good user experience and
                interface. Two technologies that are often being compared are&nbsp;<strong>Next js vs React</strong>.
                One is a framework, and the other is a library, yet they are contrasted.</p>
              <p>Both are accountable for delivering a high-quality experience for users in terms of an effective front
                end and a great digital experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://shunnoit.com/services/reactjs" target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener">Reactjs</a>&nbsp;is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces whereas Next.js
                is a production framework for React. Next.js is created on top of React and hence makes use of React
                whereas React doesn’t need Next.js for functioning.</p>
              <p>This article focuses on the basics of what is Next.js, what is React.js, their features, advantages,
                disadvantages, organizations using them when to use what, etc.</p>
              <h2 id="what-is-nextjs">What Is Next.js?</h2>
              <p>Created by Vercel, Next.js is a new-age open-source framework that works on top of React. It aims to
                make web processes faster and consists of tools that are needed for the web. Along with Node.js, it
                helps in building server-side apps or hybrid static apps.</p>
              <p>It offers a proper structure to the application and routes the pages via a simplified file folder
                system. It is meant to create SEO-based websites, landing pages, fast and higher-load web applications,
                eCommerce apps, etc.</p>
              <p>As a lightweight framework, it offers static site and server-side rendering because of which it offers
                speedy web apps. There are comprehensively pre-rendered HTML pages through which users and bots interact
                with each other.</p>
              <p>Next.js creates applications that are ready for production and offer exemplary features like smart
                bundling, server-side rendering, etc. It involves the creation of applications wherein there are a huge
                number of users involved with complicated data inflow.</p>
              <h4>Next Js Features:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Pre-rendering through server-side rendering and static generation</li>
                <li>Support for TypeScript making it liked more by developers</li>
                <li>Continuous support for Redux</li>
                <li>Configurable as per needs with simple routing mechanisms</li>
                <li>Automated build size optimization</li>
                <li>Quicker development compilation</li>
                <li>Ideal for developing landing pages of applications</li>
                <li>Creates good and fast marketing websites</li>
                <li>Excellent support for SEO-based websites and applications</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="what-is-reactjs">What Is React.js?</h2>
              <p>Powered by Facebook, React.js is a popular, open-source <a
                  href="https://shunnoit.com/services/javascript-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript
                </a>library that is used to create interactive user interfaces with ease. It is a simplified frontend
                development library that gels well with React Native and Redux for the creation of user interfaces.</p>
              <p>Since the components are declarative in nature and scalable, they are the best fit for complicated
                applications also. Developers can create SEO-friendly applications, dynamic mobile apps, interactive
                dashboards, SPA, etc.</p>
              <p>React.js facilitates developers to write the code only once and use it at multiple places, anytime and
                anywhere. It makes use of JavaScript or TypeScript to build components. It uses a reactive methodology
                with a functional programming concept.</p>
              <p>React has carved a niche for itself in the software development tools arena. Being a flexible and
                exhaustive library, with the aid of other tools like Redux, React.js has been able to showcase multiple
                features that attract developers.</p>

              <h2 id="nextjs-react-comparison">Next Js vs React: An In-depth Comparison</h2>
              <p>Before we start comparing Next.js Vs React, let us primarily understand the basic difference between a
                framework and a library. Both these terminologies look similar but have their own set of differences.
              </p>
              <p>A framework is a system of software and tools for the creation of web applications. It contains
                libraries for support in building apps. It also takes the support of programs, compilers, toolsets, and
                APIs. It offers low-level functionality support and hence sets off easily and quickly.</p>
              <p>A library is a collection of resources that can be used by developers for a simplified coding process.
                The flow of applications can be controlled through a library. It includes configuration data, message
                templates, and pre-written code.</p>
              <p>As we evaluate Next.js and React.js, the first one is a framework and the latter is a library.</p>

                <h4 id="wrap-up">Next js vs React: The Wrap Up</h4>
                <p>On comparing the two powerful tools – React.js vs Next.js, it is observed that both are powerful in
                  their own territories and offer different types of application creation. Though developers do get
                  confused about when to use Next.js and when to use React.js, both are easy to learn, have good
                  documentation and community support, are cost-effective, and offer a great developer experience.</p>
                <p>Developers must analyze and finalize the frontend web development tool based on deciding factors such
                  as SEO requirements, coding essentials, performance needs, project timelines, skilled resource
                  availability, etc.</p>
                <p>React will help when there is a creation of beautiful web apps. Next.js will help when there is an
                  SEO-based website with image creation etc. So, as a final say, it is difficult to pinpoint anyone.
                  Choose either and it will be a beneficial choice!</p>
